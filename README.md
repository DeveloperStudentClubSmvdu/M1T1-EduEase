# EduEase - Student hub

This Proof of Concept (POC) project aims to build a website/platform where college students can find their academic-related stuff in one place.

## Goals

- **Class**: Maintain a daily class schedule calendar. Class representatives (CRs) can post updates, revise class status (cancelled, postponed, etc.), edit the schedule, and post notices. Students can opt-in to recieve class reminders and notifications.
- **Clubs**: Let clubs (including NSS and other semi-club bodies) post-event notifications and maintain an event calendar. Students can subscribe to individual events or all of a club's activities.
- **Study**: Users can upload suitable academic resources (previous year question papers, class notes, tips/advice) to aid students seeking such resources and earn "reputations". These reputations will be publicly accesible and may be used by connected bodies for various purposes (e.g., sorting out tied students).
